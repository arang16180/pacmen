# Pacmen

## Description
The project runs a screen with a background where 2 buttons can be found. One of them is for creating the characters (there are 4 of them). The other button is for starting the game, and for increasing the speed of the characters, they will bounce with the edges of the navigator, even if the size changes.

## How to run
In order to run this project it is only necessary to open index.html in the navigator, with the rest of the files in the same folder of index.html.

## Future improvements
- [ ] allow interaction between characters
- [ ] the building of an scenario
- [ ] score of the game
